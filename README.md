# fuzzypp
#### C++ Fuzzy Hashing Library

## About
this is a c++ port of the great work done by kolos450 over at https://github.com/kolos450/SsdeepNET.
"Port" is used loosely and should probably read as "translated" from C# to C++.

## Compilation
```sh
git clone https://github.com/rustysec/fuzzypp
cd fuzzypp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
```
## Running
```sh
./fuzzypp /bin/bash
```
Gives us:
